      Your account has been activated for Rook Beta.

      Rook has been my learning project for the last few months. But now, I want to make
      it something useful to others. That is where beta testers like you come in. I want
      to make rook valuable for people like you. People eager to learn, people with skills
      to teach.

      Please, log on and check it out. As you might have guessed, this is not the final
      product. For example, right now I am working on getting a password reset working.
      And I am looking into if I should use Faye to make messaging a bit more dynamic.
      But the core of my inital idea works. In the coming weeks, I hope to get your
      brutally honest feedback translated into working code.

      I have set up a subreddit, www.reddit.com/r/rook to make posts about questions,
      feature requests, and error reporting. I will also be posting updates on my
      progress.

      Thank you,
